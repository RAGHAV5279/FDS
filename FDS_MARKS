'''Write a Python program to store marks scored in subject “Fundamental of Data 
Structure” by N students in the class. Write functions to compute following:
a) The average score of class 
b) Highest score and lowest score of class 
c) Count of students who were absent for the test
d) Display mark with highest frequency*/ give with comment and logic in wording'''
